BlockValidator also does:
+ chain validation
    - Is this block on a valid chain?
    - Are all its predecessors known?
  I think this should (if it isn't already) be the responsibility of the
  completer. The block should be guaranteed to be from a valid chain before it
  reaches the BlockValidator.

+ batch validation
    - Are any transactions in this block duplicates that have occurred ANYWHERE
      else in the history of the block chain.
    - This is what ChainCommitState handles, which I think could also use a
      little rework.

+ fork resolution
    - Asks consensus if this should be the new fork.
    - run() ultimately tells the ChainController whether or not to switch
      forks.
    I think it would make more sense to return the information needed to
    resolve forks to the ChainController, and let it make the decision, so that
    the fork resolution logic is in the ChainController and not in the
    BlockValidator.
