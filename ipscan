  b) Runtime

gcc
openssl
libssl1.0.0
  a) libssl1.0.0 was added to support loading key pairs generated with openssl.
     It is used in the Rust and Go Client SDKs. openssl is installed in the Seth
     docker image for demonstration purposes, but is run separately from any
     Sawtooth components.
  b) libssl1.0.0 is runtime iff using the Rust or Go client SDKs. openssl is
     not runtime.

  a) These are used to collect stats and metrics from a running deployment and
     publish them to a dashboard.
  b) Optional runtime dependencies

alien
libcurl4-openssl-dev
libprotobuf-dev
libxml2-dev
uuid-dev
  a) These were added to the SGX Installation instructions because they were
     part of the Intel instructions here: https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/linux-1.8/docs/Intel_SGX_SDK_Installation_Guide_Linux_1.8_Open_Source.pdf
  b) alien is a build dependency. I am not sure if the others are build or
     runtime, need to check with Ryan.

  a) These are part of the SGX Installation instructions but are not in the
