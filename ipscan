python3-sawtooth-identity
python3-sawtooth-poet-sgx
  a) These are Sawtooth packages that we build and distribute.
  b) Runtime, iff the deployment is using that package.

python3
  a) Sawtooth is written in python3
  b) Runtime

gcc
openssl
libssl1.0.0
  a) libssl1.0.0 was added to support loading key pairs generated with openssl.
     It is used in the Rust and Go Client SDKs. openssl is installed in the Seth
     docker image for demonstration purposes, but is run separately from any
     Sawtooth components.
  b) libssl1.0.0 is runtime iff using the Rust or Go client SDKs. openssl is
     not runtime.

telegraf
python3-pyformance
  a) These are used to collect stats and metrics from a running deployment and
     publish them to a dashboard.
  b) Optional runtime dependencies

alien
libcurl4-openssl-dev
libprotobuf-dev
libxml2-dev
uuid-dev
  a) These were added to the SGX Installation instructions because they were
     part of the Intel instructions here: https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/linux-1.8/docs/Intel_SGX_SDK_Installation_Guide_Linux_1.8_Open_Source.pdf
  b) alien is a build dependency. I am not sure if the others are build or
     runtime, need to check with Ryan.

protobuf-compiler
python
ocaml
  a) These are part of the SGX Installation instructions but are not in the
     Intel guide. I need to check with Ryan.
  b) Not sure.

libcrypto++9v5
liblog4cxx10v5
libzmqpp3
  a) These are installed by the C++ SDK.
  b) I believe these are runtime dependencies for anyone using the C++ SDK.
     Dan or Cian would know more.

python-psycopg2
python3-aiopg
python3-psycopg2
  a) These are installed as part of the vagrant environment.
  b) These are optional development dependencies, but not runtime dependencies.

solc
  a) This can be used by Solidity developers to compile Solidity smart
     contracts. It is included in the Seth docker image for demonstration
     purposes.
  b) Not a dependency.

pip

mock
  a) This is used in python3 unittests.
  b) Test dependency (not runtime).
pyformance
  a) These are used to collect stats and metrics from a running deployment and
     publish them to a dashboard.
  b) Optional runtime dependencies
setuptools
  a) This is used to build Sawtooth python3 packages.
  b) Build/installation dependency, not a runtime dependency.

npm

ethereumjs-abi
web3
  a) These can be used by Solidity developers to interact with Seth. They are
     included in the Seth docker image for demonstration purposes.
